# Sentilysis @ SpurHacks 2025
## ðŸš€ Inspiration
We wanted to make real-time stock sentiment and global event analysis accessible and visually engaging for everyone. With so much financial news and data, itâ€™s hard to see the big picture so we built Sentilysis to combine AI, live data, and interactive visuals in a single dashboard.

## How we built it
Frontend: Next.js (React), Tailwind CSS, Chart.js for charts, and Three.js for the animated globe. Backend: FastAPI for news aggregation, sentiment analysis, and AI-powered summaries. AI: Integrated with OpenAI for natural language sentiment summaries. Deployment: Vercel for frontend, backend hosted separately (e.g., Render/Railway). Features: Custom skeleton loaders for smooth UX, scrollable chat, and responsive design.

## Challenges
API integration: Handling CORS and environment variables for backend/frontend communication, especially in production. UI/UX: Making the dashboard visually appealing and responsive, with smooth loading states. Data consistency: Ensuring real-time updates and accurate sentiment aggregation from multiple sources. Globe rendering: Integrating Three.js with React and keeping performance smooth.
